        Currently, our catalog list (<Code>catalog/list</Code>) is being loaded
        into a static path (<Code>/shop</Code>); however, we'd like to be able
        to navigate to different categories using the filters MFE (
        <Code>catalog/filters</Code>). The filters component has four
        categories, each navigating to its URL-encoded namesake.

        Update the routing logic in the shell application to load the catalog

        You already have the services to update the useCatalogList hook. Once
        you have the category, you can update the queryKey configuration for the
