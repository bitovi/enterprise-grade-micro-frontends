        Currently, if an MFE goes down, our entire application goes down, which,
        considering most of our MFEs are not "mission critical", this is an
        issue.

        If you want to see it in action, throw an error in any component in an
        MFE.

        If the Filter MFE goes down, our customers should still be able to shop
        in the catalog, just in a limited capacity. If you want to see it in
        action, throw an error in any component in an MFE.

        To remedy this, the shell application needs to wrap our MFEs in a
        Suspense boundary and an error boundary. Rather than creating an error
        boundary from scratch, we will use{" "}
        <Anchor href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-error-boundary">
          react-error-boundary.

        Add error boundaries to each of the MFEs the shell application is
        currently using. The fallbacks can be as intricate or plain as youâ€™d
        like - feel free to explore using Mantine to create more elaborate
        fallbacks.
