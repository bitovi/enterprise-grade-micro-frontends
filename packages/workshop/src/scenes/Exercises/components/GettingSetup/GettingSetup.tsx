        This workshop makes a couple assumptions about your development environment. Firstly you have node (v22+), npm
        and git setup on your computer. If you don't - no worries - the following links will help you out:

        Once cloned, checkout out the <Code>main</Code> branch and open the project in your IDE of choice - although
        this will be written with vscode in mind - and install the project dependencies.

        you should see the application opened with a “Hello - Nice to meet you!” message. Once you see the message you
        can go ahead and kill the dev server.

        Let's talk about Nx. We won't be covering how to use nx apart from what we need to run our application. This
        workshop is in a package-base nx project. A package is any project located in the packages directory.

      <Text pt="md">To run a command in a single package you can use the following pattern</Text>
      <CodeHighlight my="lg" code={`nx run <package-name>:<npm-script-name>`} />
      <Text>
        Try running the dev command in the <Code>workshop</Code> package and navigate the the url. Look familiar? (You
        should see “Hello - Nice to meet you!”)
      </Text>
      <Text pt="md">
        You can also run multiple project commands of the same name using run-many instead of run using the following
        pattern.
      </Text>
      <Alert title="A Quick Note on run-many" icon={<IconInfoCircle />} my="xl">
        run-many only runs three processes by default. To run more than three, you can add the parallel flag to run more
        than that <Code>{`--parallel=<number-you-want-to-run>`}</Code>
      </Alert>
      <CodeHighlight my="lg" code={`nx run-many -t <command>`} />
      <Text>Try running the dev command with run-many and parallel set to 6</Text>
