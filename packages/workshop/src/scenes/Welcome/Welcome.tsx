              There are several different ways to create and compose
              micro-frontends - this application is an SPA that uses the
              following stack:

              Over the course of this workshop we will be building out an ecom
              app! If you want to see the final result, click the{" "}

              exercises we will do together throughout the workshop, but first,
              we need to get you set up.
